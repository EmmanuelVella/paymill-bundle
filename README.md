**WORK IN PROGRESS, DO NOT USE**

# paymill-bundle
Straight forward integration of [Paymill](http://paymill.com) payments into Symfony 2 applications. Makes your life easier in two ways:

* Credit Card form to include in your page (pictured below)
* High-level API to use in your controllers

![Credit card form screenshot](Resources/doc/form.png)

The Credit Card form can be included directly in your page (no *iframes*). It's inspired by [Stripe's Checkout](https://stripe.com/blog/stripe-checkout) and uses [jquery.payment](https://github.com/stripe/jquery.payment) and [Paymill's Bridge](https://www.paymill.com/en-gb/documentation-3/reference/paymill-bridge/). **It's completely optional**, which means you can easily roll your own and still use this bundle in the backend. If you decide to use it, you still have 100% control of how it looks.

In the backend, [JMSPaymentCoreBundle](https://github.com/schmittjoh/JMSPaymentCoreBundle) is used. This allows you to add new payment backends (e.g Paypal) with minimum changes to your code. It uses [Paymill's PHP library](https://github.com/Paymill/Paymill-PHP) under the hood.

## Features

* Plug-and-play credit card form, inspired by Stripe's Checkout (optional)
* Support for Paymill's [client resources](https://www.paymill.com/it-it/documentation-3/reference/api-reference/#clients)

### Coming soon

* [Webhooks](https://www.paymill.com/it-it/documentation-3/reference/api-reference/#webhooks)
* [Refunds](https://www.paymill.com/it-it/documentation-3/reference/api-reference/#refunds)
* [Preauthorizations](https://www.paymill.com/it-it/documentation-3/reference/api-reference/#preauthorizations)

## Setup
Note that this bundle uses functionality provided by [JMSPaymentCoreBundle](https://github.com/schmittjoh/JMSPaymentCoreBundle). These instructions will also guide you through the installation of that bundle.

### Installation
Add the following to your `composer.json`:

```json
{
    "require": {
        "fitmemes/paymill-bundle": "@dev"
    }
}
```

You can then install the bundle and it's dependencies by running Composerâ€™s `update` command from the directory where your `composer.json` file is located:

    $ php composer.phar update fitmemes/paymill-bundle

Then register the new bundles in `AppKernel.php`:

```php
// app/AppKernel.php
$bundles = array(
    // ...
    new JMS\Payment\CoreBundle\JMSPaymentCoreBundle(),
    new Fm\PaymentPaymillBundle\FmPaymentPaymillBundle(),
    // ...
);
```

Finally, you need to tell *Assetic* about this bundle:

```yml
// app/config.yml
assetic:
    bundles: ['AcmeSomeBundle', 'FmPaymentPaymillBundle']
```

### Configuration

[JMSPaymentCoreBundle's](https://github.com/schmittjoh/JMSPaymentCoreBundle) configuration is as easy as choosing a random secret string which will be used for encrypting data. Note that if you change the secret all data encrypted with the old secret will become unreadable.

```yml
jms_payment_core:
    secret: somesecret
```

Finally, you need to specify Paymill's private and public keys. You'll need to create a Paymill account if you don't have one and retrieve it's private and public keys. Refer to [Paymill's documentation](https://www.paymill.com/en-gb/documentation-3/introduction/brief-instructions/) for information on how to accomplish this.

```yml
// app/config.yml
fm_payment_paymill:
    api_private_key: paymill_api_private_key
    api_public_key:  paymill_api_public_key
```

### Create database tables
JMSPaymentCoreBundle needs a few database tables so you'll have to create them. If you want to know more about the data model see [JMSPaymentCoreBundle's documentation](http://jmsyst.com/bundles/JMSPaymentCoreBundle/master/model).

If you're using [database migrations](http://symfony.com/doc/current/bundles/DoctrineMigrationsBundle/index.html), you can create the new tables with following commands:

    php app/console doctrine:migrations:diff
    php app/console doctrine:migrations:migrate

Or, if you're not using migrations:

    php app/console doctrine:schema:update

## How it works
At the end of your app's checkout workflow, you'll have a form where your customer enters his credit card information. This bundle comes packaged with a template that you include in your page which renders such form as pictured above. You are free to change how it looks in any way you see fit by changing its markup and/or CSS.

In order for you to not have to worry about PCI compliance, the credit card information your customers enter in the form should never reach your servers. This is where [Paymill's Bridge](https://www.paymill.com/en-gb/documentation-3/reference/paymill-bridge/) comes into action: it's a small javascript library that makes an Ajax request to Paymill's servers containing the credit card information. The response to this request is a unique `token`.

You then submit the form to your server, excluding the credit card information but including the `token` returned from Paymill's server. In your controller, this `token` will be used to make a request to Paymill's API and [create a transaction](https://www.paymill.com/it-it/documentation-3/reference/api-reference/#create-new-transaction-with), aka a Payment. (If fact, you will not make requests to Paymill's API directly, you'll be using the high-level API made available by JMSPaymentCoreBundle.) If the `transaction` was successfuly created, the money was transferred to your Paymill account and you're done.

See [paymill-bundle-example](https://github.com/fitmemes/paymill-bundle-example) for an example Symfony app that uses this bundle.

## Rendering the form
You need to include some scripts in the pages in which you plan on using this bundle. To simplify this, a Twig function is available, which you'll typically call before the closing `<body>` tag:

```twig
{{ paymill_initialize() }}
```

This will simply render the [Resources/views/init.html.twig](Resources/views/init.html.twig) template. If you have special requirements, instead of calling `paymill_initialize()` you can copy the contents of the template and paste it in your page, modifying it as you see fit.

### Modifying the default form
The Credit Card form is where your customers will enter their credit card information. It consists of a [PaymillType](Form/PaymillType.php) and a [template](Resources/views/form.html.twig) that defines how each field of the form is rendered.
